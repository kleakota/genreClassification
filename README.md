# Music Genre Classification

This is a Neural Networks project specified in training a model for music genre classification. The project compares how three models VGG16, ResNet50 and MobileNet perform in terms of accuracy for classifying different muscic genres into the correct labels. 

The dataset used for this challenge is GTZAN Dataset, which contains: 
- original genres, 10 genres with 100 audio files each
- original images, representing the audios as spectrograms
- 2 CSV files, containing features of the audios

The Evaluation Metrics chosen for this task are a Confusion Matrix and a Classification Report. Based on the values we generated, we investigated the differences in training, testing and overall perfomance for each network model.
